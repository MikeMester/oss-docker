# oss-docker
This Repo is mainly for experimentation.  Working with Docker.

The components that I plan to use are:

## Kafka - Provides the messagebus for the OSS platform
## Zookeeper 
## CollectD - collects metrics from host systems
## Logstash - collects logs from host systems
## InfluxDB - stores timeseries data
## Kibana - Interface to Elasticsearch (kibana 4)
## Zabbix Server - Zabbix Server Process
## Zabbix Agent - Zabbix Agent
## Zabbix Java Gateway - 
## Grafana
